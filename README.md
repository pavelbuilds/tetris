# tetris

I started this project by following Michael Kar√©n's tutorial that you can find here:

After finishing building the game based on the tutorial's approach I added a few features on my own including:

- a new game design

- a multi player mode

- the original game sounds as well as the soundtrack

ENJOY! :)
